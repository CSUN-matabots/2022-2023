# CSUN Matabots 
This repository is for the CSUN Matabots VEX robot code 
2022-2023 School Year

# Qualifying
This folder contains code for two identical robots (Nys and Erebus) that competed in regional competitions. These robots have an autonomous code that uses a tracking wheel for position tracking, as well as a drive code that is uploaded to a controller for driver control. These robots contained a combination of motors and pneumatics that controlled different systems such as silicon rollers for moving stationary field rollers, omni-directional wheels, and a ratcheting system flywheel that shoots disks into a goal at various driver-controlled angles. 

# Team 1 and Team 2
These folders were created for new members to learn how to program robots in VEX V5 Code Pro which is written in C++. 

# Worlds
This folder contains code that was used on two different robots that competed in the VEX World's Championship 2023. Code was writtin in C++ using VS Code and the PROS extension for VEX-specific syntax. These robots have autonomous code that uses a tracking wheel for position tracking, as well as a drive code that is uploaded to a controller for driver control. Both robots utilize a combination of motors and pneumatics that controlled different systems such as silicon rollers for moving stationary field rollers, and omni-directional wheels. 
Catapult robot that was designed to shoot 3 disks at a time, from various distances, into a goal 24in off the ground. 
Flywheel robot was designed to shoot 1 disk at a time, into a goal 24in off the ground, from various distances, and could switch between 3 different speeds and an angle-changer depending on the position on the field.
